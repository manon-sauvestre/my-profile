     <h2>Why do I love to travel🏞?</h2>
     <p>
       Well, it's quite simple. It's because I enjoy discovering new cultures, traditions..., learning the customs of the people, meeting new people, discovering new cultures🧳...But, traveling does not only allow us to discover new things, traveling helps us, I find, to look at the world in a different way.Travel also allows us to discover ourselves because we are confronted with unusual situations, and thanks to these unpredictable situations, we gain autonomy.<strong>Finally, when we travel, we are free, there are no more borders.🏔</strong>
